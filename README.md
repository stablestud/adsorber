(Ad)sorber blocks ads by 'absorbing' and dumbing them into the void.    

Technically speaking, it adds ad-domains to the hostname / DNS lookup file `/etc/hosts`,    
with a redirection to a non-existent ip `0.0.0.0`, which prevents ads from being loaded system-wide.

You can consider it as [AdAway](https://github.com/AdAway/AdAway) for non Android systems running on Linux.

* [Requirements](#requirements)
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Removal](#removal)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Configuration](#configuration)
* [Logging](#logging)
* [License](#license)

## Features
* Blocks advertisements system-wide, not only in the browser
* Prevents annoying anti-adblockers from triggering
* Update your ad-domain list with domains from external external sources (like https://adaway.org/hosts.txt)
* Revert to the previous hosts file if the current hosts file contains broken ad-domains
* Automatically update the hosts file with *schedulers* (cronjob or systemd service)
* White- and blacklist specific domains

### Confirmed working on:
* `arch linux`
* `debian` on `jessie` and `buster`
* `ubuntu` on `bionic`
* `gentoo`
* `solus` on `fortitude`
* `fedora` on v30+

Adsorber will very likely work on every distribution, as it runs on POSIX shell.

## Requirements
* `root` rights (e.g. with `sudo`)
* The following should be supported on all distros by default:
  * `/bin/sh`
  * `/etc/hosts`
  * `curl` or `wget`

## Installation
Download Adsorber from [`releases`](https://github.com/stablestud/adsorber/releases) or clone it.

__Two possibilites:__
* [Install](#install-recommended) to system (recommended)
* [Portable mode](#portable-mode) without installation

### Install (recommended)
Adsorber will be placed onto your system (to `/usr/local/`).

1. Execute the file `./place_files_onto_system.sh` as `root`
2. Run the command `adsorber enable`
3. Answer the prompts to configure Adsorber
4. Finished! You can remove the downloaded files.

If you have a super custom system you can configure where Adsorber should be placed, edit the relevant lines in `place_files_onto_system.sh` and `remove_files_from_system.sh`     
However the default path (`/usr/local/`) is the default for external scripts on Linux (see [here](http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/fhs-2.3.html#USRLOCALLOCALHIERARCHY)) and should be fine for most systems.

Placing Adsorber has the advantage to run it independently from the user who downloaded it,
preventing broken cronjobs/services as there is no risk that the files/directories of Adsorber will be accidentally deleted or moved.

To reverse the steps (complete uninstall) see [removal](#removal)

### Portable mode
This mode will only download the recent ad-domains and merges them into your hosts file.     
Note: You won't be able to set a scheduler.

1. Execute `./portable_adsorber.sh enable` to generate the config files
2. Execute `./portable_adsorber.sh enable` again to continue
3. Finished!

If you want to update your hosts file you need to do it yourself by running `./portable_adsorber.sh start`
If you want to restore your hosts file to its default run `./portable_adsorber.sh stop`

Portable-mode won't touch the system except for `/etc/hosts` which is required to block ad-domains. A backup will be created at `/etc/hosts.original`.

## Removal
#### Automatic removal
To completely remove Adsorber and all its changes run the script [`./remove_files_from_system.sh`](https://github.com/stablestud/adsorber/blob/master/remove_files_from_system.sh) as `root`.    
The script also works on [portable mode](#portable-mode) setups. However running `./portable_adsorber.sh disable` instead should suffice.

#### Manual removal
If you prefer manual removal, here you go:
1. delete inline:
* `/etc/hosts`    
  Delete everything between the lines:
  `# BEGIN OF ADSORBER SECTION` and `# END OF ADSORBER SECTION`
2. remove:
* `/etc/hosts.original`
* `/usr/local/bin/adsorber`
* `/usr/local/etc/adsorber/`
* `/usr/local/lib/adsorber/`
* `/usr/local/share/adsorber/`
* `/etc/systemd/system/adsorber.service`
* `/etc/systemd/system/adsorber.time`
* `/etc/cron.hourly/80adsorber`
* `/etc/cron.daily/80adsorber`
* `/etc/cron.weekly/80adsorber`
* `/etc/cron.monthly/80adsorber`
* `/var/cache/adsorber`
* **`/var/log/adsorber.log`** <- won't be removed automatically
* **`/etc/hosts.original`** <- won't be removed automatically
* `/tmp/adsorber/`
  
Not all files of the above will exist, so dont worry if they are not found.

## Usage

### `adsorber <operation> [<options>]`
Quick link to all [operations](#operations-required) or [options](#options-optional).

Note: if you use portable mode, use `./portable_adsorber.sh` instead of `adsorber`

### Default help screen of `adsorber help`
```
Usage: adsorber <operation> [<options>|--help]

(Ad)sorber blocks ads by "absorbing" and dumbing them into void.
     (with the help of the hosts file)

Operations (required):
  - enable, setup
      setup necessary things needed for Adsorber
        e.g., create backup file of hosts file,
              create scheduler which updates the host file once a week
  - disable
      completely remove changes made by Adsorber
         e.g., disable scheduler (if set)
               restore hosts file to its original state
  - start, update
      update hosts file with newest ad-domains
  - stop, restore
      restore hosts file to its original state
      (it does not remove the scheduler, this should be used temporary)
  - revert
      reverts the hosts file to the last applied (previous) ad-domains
  - version
      show version of this shell script
  - help
      show this help

Options (optional):
  -y,  --yes, --assume-yes - answer all prompts with 'yes'
  -f,  --force             - force the update if no /etc/hosts backup
                             has been created (dangerous!)
  -h,  --help              - show specific help of specified operations
                             (e.g 'adsorber update --help)
  --noformatting           - turn off coloured and formatted output

Scheduler options (use with 'enable'):
  -ns, --no-scheduler      - skip scheduler creation
  -s,  --systemd           - setup Systemd as scheduler
  -c,  --cron              - setup Cronjob ...

### Operations (required):
To run Adsorber one of the following operations must be given:
* [`enable`](#adsorber-enable-setup-options)
* [`disable`](#adsorber-disable-options)
* [`start`](#adsorber-start-update-options)
* [`stop`](#adsorber-stop-restore-options)
* [`revert`](#adsorber-revert-options)

**Note:** to get further information about a operation run it with `--help`,    
e.g.: `adsorber start --help`

### `adsorber` `enable/setup {options}`:
You should run this command first. It is required to make Adsorber functional.    

The command will:
* backup your `/etc/hosts` file to `/etc/hosts.original` (if not other specified in `adsorber.conf`)
* setup a scheduler which updates your hosts file with ad-server domains once a week. (either systemd, cronjob or none)
* fetch the newest ad-server domains in your hosts file. (same as `update`)

Possible options are:
* [`-s`, `--systemd`](#-s---systemd)
* [`-c`, `--cronjon`](#-c---cronjob)
* [`-ns`, `--no-scheduler`](#-ns---no-scheduler)
* [`-y`, `--yes`, `--assume-yes`](#-y---yes---assume-yes)
* [`-h`, `--help`](#-h---help)
* `-H`,  `--hourly`
* `-D`,  `--daily`
* `-W`,  `--weekly`
* `-M`,  `--monthly`
* `-Q`,  `--quarterly`
* `-S`,  `--semiannually`
* `-Y`,  `--yearly`

### `adsorber` `disable {options}`:
Completely disable all background tasks (schedulers) and remove all changes made by Adsorber.    
However it will not remove Adsorber from the system. The `adsorber` command will be still available.    
To completely uninstall see [removal](#removal).

The command will:
* disable all schedulers (systemd, cronjob)
* restore the hosts file to it's original state
* remove all leftovers (cache, etc)

Possible options are:
* [`-y`, `--yes`, `--assume-yes`](#-y---yes---assume-yes)
* [`-h`, `--help`](#-h---help)

### Options (optional):
* [`-s`, `--systemd`](#-s---systemd)
* [`-c`, `--cronjon`](#-c---cronjob)
* [`-ns`, `--no-scheduler`](#-ns---no-scheduler)
* [`-y`, `--yes`, `--assume-yes`](#-y---yes---assume-yes)
* [`-f`, `--force`](#-f---force)
* [`-h`, `--help`](#-h---help)
* [`--noformatting`](#--noformatting)

### `adsorber` `stop/revert {options}`:
Reverts the last applied hosts-file by Adsorber.
 
The command will:
* downgrade `/etc/hosts` with ad-domains applied previously

This is useful if the newest hosts file contains less or no ad-domains, because a source     
was unreachable and you don't want to loose the ad-servers supplied previously from this source.

Possible option:
* [`-h`, `--help`](#-h---help)

### `adsorber` `start/restore {options}`:
Updates the hosts file with the latest ad-domains.

The command will:
* copy the current `/etc/hosts` to `/etc/hosts.previous`, if not disabled in `adsorber.conf`
* download ad-server domains from servers listed in `sources.list`
* filter those and apply them to the systems hosts file `/etc/hosts`

Possible options are:
* [`-f`, `--force`](#-f---force)
* [`-h`, `--help`](#-h---help)

### `adsorber` `stop/restore {options}`:
Restores the hosts file to its original state, without removing its backup and scheduler.

The command will:
* Remove Adsorber's inserted lines from `/etc/hosts`.

Note: If Adsorber's scheduler was set-up, it'll re-apply ad-server domains to your hosts file when triggered.     
For this reason this command is used to temporary disable Adsorber,    
e.g. when it's blocking some sites you need to access for a short period of time.     

To re-apply run [`adsorber revert`](#adsorber-revert-options) (for previous host file) or [`adsorber update`](#adsorber-update-options) (for updated version).

Possible option:
* [`-h`, `--help`](#-h---help)

#### `-s`, `--systemd`:

Option is only available with operation [`setup`](#adsorber-setup-options).     
Adsorber uses Systemd as a scheduler to update your hosts file periodically.

* Setup systemd scheduler, skipping the scheduler prompt.      

Files are placed into `/etc/systemd/system` by default.

#### `-c`, `--cronjob`:

Option is only available with operation [`setup`](#adsorber-setup-options).     
Adsorber uses Cronjob as a default scheduler to update your hosts file periodically.

* Setup the cron scheduler, skipping the scheduler prompt. 

File is placed into `/etc/cron.weekly/` by default.

#### `-ns`, `--no-scheduler`:
Option is only available with operation [`setup`](#adsorber-setup-options).     
Tells Adsorber to not install a scheduler.

* Skips the setup of a scheduler, therefore skipping the scheduler prompt. 

Adsorber won't update the host file periodically, therefore    
you'll have to update it manually with `adsorber update`.

#### `-y`, `--yes`, `--assume-yes`:

Answers all prompts with `yes` e.g.,
* `Do you really want to setup Adsorber?`
* `Do you really want to disable Adsorber?`

Note: it'll not answer prompts which may harm your system. But `--force` will.

#### `-f`, `--force`:

Option is only available with operation [`update`](#adsorber-update-options).

This will force the script to continue (dangerous!) the update e.g.,
* Continues if no backup has been created, overwriting the existing hosts file.

#### `-h`, `--help`:

Show general help or if specified with an operation,    
show specific help about operation e.g.,    
`adsorber setup --help`

#### `--noformatting`:
Disables coloured and formatted output by Adsorber.     
Can be used with every operation or option.    
Useful for logging to files and output processing by other scripts.

## Configuration:

By default the config files are located at `/usr/local/etc/adsorber/`.     
In portable-mode the config files are being created at the scripts root directory after the first run.

Config files you may want to edit:
* `adsorber.conf` - general configuration
* `sources.list`  - sources to fetch from
* `whitelist`     - domains which should not be blocked
* `blacklist`     - domains which should be always blocked

By default Adsorber uses the following external sources:
* [`adaway.org`](https://adaway.org/hosts.txt) (also used by AdAway)
* [`yoyo.org`](https://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/serverlist.php?hostformat=hosts&showintro=0&mimetype=plaintext) (also used by AdAway)

To add your own ad-domain sources, just add them to `sources.list`.

## Logging:

Schedulers (systemd service or cronjob) will pass their output to the Syslog process and to `/var/log/adsorber.log`.      
The syslog can be examined at `/var/log/syslog`.

## Todo for future releases
You're free to implement things listed *-or-* not listed in [`TODO.md`](https://github.com/stablestud/adsorber/blob/master/TODO.md)  to Adsorber.
Any additions are always appreciated. :)
